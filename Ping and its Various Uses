Ping and Its Various Uses

Lab Objective:
Learn how to use ping and its different parameters.

Lab Purpose:
Ping is a simple and useful network-based utility which can be used to identify if a host is alive or dead. Technically, we can call it an echo reply. By “alive”, I mean that the host is active, and by “dead”, that the host is in shutdown mode. Anything which has a network card can be a host: computers, servers, switches, websites, smartphones, IOT devices, etc.
It is often useful when setting up some new infrastructure to use ping to test if your infrastructure can correctly reach the network.

Lab Tool:
Kali Linux or Windows
